<p>Hello! In this blog post I wanted to talk a bit about an image editor
software program that I made recently, mainly what it does and my
motivation behind developing it. Basically with this program, PFJ Image
Editor, you’re able to apply different filters and effects to images.
For example, you can apply brightness, contrast, saturation, mirroring,
threshold etc.. You’re able to control the intensity of each filter and
you can apply multiple filters on an image at once if you want. There’s
also some presets you can use that have preset values for the effects.
It’s pretty easy to create cool looking edits of images this way. You’re
also able to analyze the image, like looking at how the color channels
of the image are distributed using a histogram plot. This way you can
see how different filters alter an image’s pixel values in real
time.</p>
<p>Back in April or May, we had a unit on pixels and image filters in my
computer science class. We did some assignments like coding our own
effects and seeing how they’d affect images. Stuff like brightness,
grayscale, isolating color channels. We actually used software made in
Java to analyze and display the images and filters we made. I’m pretty
sure the software used Java’s Swing API for graphics and GUI. There was
lots of Java style sliders, buttons, text fields, scroll bars, things
like that. I was really inspired by this program, (especially because we
had the source code in Java and were able to see how it worked!), so I
decided to make my own image editing program, although not using Java
Swing but another graphics library called Processing.</p>

<p>Probably the hardest part of development was finding a way to apply
filters to an image without causing a massive FPS drop. Some filters are
more preformance intensive than others. For example, brightness and
threshold aren’t too bad, but bloom and blur can be pretty slow
depending on their intensity. My goal was to have the filter “load in”
and take its time, as opposed to craming in all the calculations into a
single frame and causing a massive lag spike. Sometimes you may see the
image take a few moments to apply all its filters completely, this is to
insure a constant and smooth FPS! Besides that I also spent some time
messing around with all the combinations of filters with images and
making presets. It was actually really fun. I’d say my favorite filters
to use are bloom and a combination of color threshold and mirroring. I
also find the effects look especially cool on a nature type image with
trees and the sky and clouds with lots of contrasting colors.</p>
<p>Anyway that’s a quick summary of what the software is and why I made
it. As always if you have questions or feedback please contact me at: <a
