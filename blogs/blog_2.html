Stars and Polygons</h1>
<p>Published: October 28, 2023</p>
<p>Another blog I’m writing on my new personal website… yay !! This blog
is entitled ‘Functions for Stars and Polygons.’ I started this a while
back with the vague goal of graphing a five-pointed star with a
function. Any function really, but it had to draw out a star. There are
many methods of going about this type of thing; you could use polar
functions, parametric functions, or other techniques that aren’t even
functions (which I end up doing too.) This blog post serves as an
outline of my journey. It’s also a way to highlight some logic and math
I found interesting and want to share, so hopefully you may learn
something or get inspired or at the very least enjoy reading this
post.</p>

<p>I’m going to start with a way to graph a star with a polar function.
A polar function is a function defined in polar cordinates, described by
a radius <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> and an angle <span
class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>. The polar coordinate system is
actually super convenient for drawing something like a star, because you
can kind of think of a star as being nice and symetrical around <span
class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>. Which in theory should make it
nice and easy to find a function for.</p>
<p><img src="../imgs/star_2_2.png" alt="img_sep" /><br />
</p>
<p>The shape we’re looking to graph, a five-pointed star, is made up
exclusively of straight and diagonal lines. Each line is angled and
positioned in such a way that they connect and form five sides of a
star. How can this pattern of diagonal lines be graphed with a polar
function?</p>
<p>We can start with an expression for a vertical line in polar
form:</p>
<p><span
class="math display">\[r=\frac{1}{\frac{1}{A}\cos(\theta)}\]</span></p>
<p>Where <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is the intersection with
the x-axis.</p>
<!-- <iframe src="https://www.desmos.com/calculator/dgjiddulgw?embed" width="400" height="400" frameborder=0></iframe> -->
<p>And an expression for a diagonal line in polar form:</p>
<p><span
class="math display">\[r=\frac{1}{\frac{1}{A}\cos(\theta)+\frac{1}{{\color{orange}B}}\sin(\theta)}\]</span></p>
<p>Where <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is the intersection with
the x-axis and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is the
intersection with the y-axis.</p>

<p>Why does this expression take this form? There’s a <span
class="math inline">\(\cos(\theta)\)</span> and a <span
class="math inline">\(\sin(\theta)\)</span> and they’re in the
denominator. Seems like this somehow relates to <span
class="math inline">\(\sec(\theta)\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\csc(\theta)\)</span>. This relationship does make
sense, since <span class="math inline">\(r=\sec(\theta)\)</span> results
in a vertical line and <span
class="math inline">\(r=\csc(\theta)\)</span> results in a horizontal
line. Naturally combining the two into one expression would make a
diagonal line.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On a side note, something kind of interesting with the diagonal line
expression is its behaviour when <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>
or <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> change. For example, as say
<span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> increases, the <span
class="math inline">\(\sin(\theta)\)</span> term loses magnitude. As
<span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> goes all the way out to <span
class="math inline">\(\infty\)</span>, the <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{B}\sin(\theta)\)</span> term approaches
<span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{\infty}\sin(\theta)\)</span> or
<span class="math inline">\(0\sin(\theta)\)</span>. This results in the
expression losing <span class="math inline">\(sin(\theta)\)</span> and
turning into the expression for a vertical line: <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{\frac{1}{A}\cos(\theta)}\)</span>. This
is also reflected in the graph. As <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> approaches <span
class="math inline">\(\infty\)</span> the slope increases making the
graph approach a vertical line.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>On another side note, the reciprocal of this diagonal line
expression, <span
class="math inline">\(r=A\cos(\theta)+B\sin(\theta)\)</span>, results in
a similar looking graph, but also something slightly different:</p>

</iframe>
<blockquote>
<p>For <span
class="math inline">\(r=A\cos(\theta)+B\sin(\theta)\)</span> when <span
class="math inline">\(\theta=0\)</span>, the radius only depends on the
value of <span class="math inline">\(\cos(\theta)\)</span>. When <span
class="math inline">\(\theta=\frac{\pi}{2}\)</span> the radius only
depends on the value of <span
class="math inline">\(\sin(\theta)\)</span>. Putting coeffeicents before
the terms allows us to control the x-axis and y-axis intersections of
the circle. In the above graph, the coefficent of cos is held constant
at 1, so there’s an intersection at (1, 0). The coefficent of sin can
change so there’s an intersection at (0, value of the coefficent of
sin). This expression is similar to the expression of the diagonal line,
the coeffeicents of cos and sin can be changed to control the x-axis and
y-axis intersections respectively. The difference is this expression
yeilds a circle while the previous yeilds a straight line.</p>

<p>Before we move to graphing multiple lines at once with an expression,
we should touch on how these lines will be angled. For a five-pointed
star we will need five lines. And the sum of the interior angles will be
<span class="math inline">\(360\textdegree\)</span>, or <span
class="math inline">\(2\pi\)</span>. If you follow the lines you will
see the path of a five-pointed star does two full roations around its
origin. A triangle does one roation and its interior angles sum to <span
class="math inline">\(180\textdegree\)</span>, so our five-pointed
star’s interior angles will sum to <span
class="math inline">\(360\textdegree\)</span>. Also notice for a
five-pointed star, all interior angles are equal. In other words, we
could say something like each side of the star should be angled <span
class="math inline">\(72\textdegree\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{2\pi}{5}\)</span> radians more than the
previous. (We could also generalize this statement a bit and say for any
n sided star, it’s interior angles are equal to <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{2\pi}{n}\)</span>.)</p>
<p>How can these five lines of a five-pointed star be graphed with one
expression? And how can we control the interior angles so that they make
up the correctly numbered sided star? First we can employ the help of
the modulo operator.</p>
<p>For example, <span class="math inline">\(y=mod(x, 1)\)</span>:</p>
<p><img src="../imgs/blog_1_desmos_3_4.png" title="Graph of y=mod(x,1)"
alt="img_graph" /><br />
</p>
<p>The modulo operator divides the input by a certain number and ouputs
the remainder of that division. Notice the usual <span
class="math inline">\(y=x\)</span> graph repeats every 1. If the
expression is <span class="math inline">\(y=mod(x, 2)\)</span> the graph
would repeat every 2. We can use this in polar coordinates to achieve
the same graph repeating effect.</p>
<p>For example, <span
class="math inline">\(r=mod(\theta,\frac{\pi}{2})\)</span>:</p>
<p><img src="../imgs/blog_1_desmos_4_2.jpg"
title="Graph of r=mod(θ,π/2)" alt="img_graph" /><br />
</p>
<p>We can also use the modulo operator for our diagonal line
expression:</p>

<p>Where <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> is the interval <span
class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> the function repeats on. <!--
Plugging in $\frac{2\pi}{5}$ to the modulo operator yeilds:
This shape is very close to a star. It has 5 sides which are straight lines and they're at the correct angles. It's just they're too, slanted maybe? What if we alter the modulus value for only the $\sin(\theta)$ term?
So close! But also not quite there yet. Let's look back at our goal, a five-pointed star. Notice its lines are straight, really straight. They're almost more like long straight vertical lines than diagonal lines. Actually, what if we were to remove the sin term completely? We'd be left with a expression for a vertical line again, but this time with a modulo.
$r=\frac{1}{\cos(\theta\mod\frac{2\pi}{5})}
Wow! half a star! So we can see this clearly now. The star really is a series of vertical line expressions. And since there's a modulo, the function keeps repeating after certain $\theta$ values have been reached, resulting in the vertical lines being angled every $\frac{2\pi}{5}$, resulting in half a five-sided star!
--></p>
<p>After trial and error, I eventually found an expression that almost
yields the star I’m looking for:</p>
<p><span
class="math display">\[r=\frac{1}{\cos\left(\operatorname{mod}\left(\theta-\frac{\pi}{10},\frac{2\pi}{5}\right)\right)}\]</span></p>
<p><img src="../imgs/blog_1_desmos_6.jpg"
title="Graph of half of a five-pointed star" alt="img_graph" /><br />
</p>
<p>A couple things to note: the <span
class="math inline">\(-\frac{\pi}{10}\)</span> term is added to <span
class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> in order to rotate the star so
it’s facing upwards correctly, and also it seems like half the star is
missing. The graph can be flipped by multiplying the <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{2\pi}{5}\)</span> term by -1:</p>
<p><img src="../imgs/blog_1_desmos_7.jpg"
title="Graph of the other half of a five-pointed star"
alt="img_graph" /><br />
</p>
<p>Great so we now have two graphs in polar coordinates that describe a
five pointed star. But in order to draw a star with just one function,
we need a way to draw out both halves of the star. Maybe we could draw
out the first half of the star, then draw out the other half, combining
these two functions in some way. The only difference between the two
functions is the <span class="math inline">\(\frac{2\pi}{5}\)</span>
term. One half of the star is drawn with the term <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{2\pi}{5}\)</span> being positive and the
other half being negative. We could add a new term to toggle the <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{2\pi}{5}\)</span> term from positive to
negative. On the interval of <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>
from 0 to <span class="math inline">\(2\pi\)</span> the <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{2\pi}{5}\)</span> term will be positive and
on the interval <span class="math inline">\(2\pi\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(4\pi\)</span> it will be negative. This way we
could draw out both functions with a single expression, switching the
sign of the <span class="math inline">\(\frac{2\pi}{5}\)</span> term
halfway through.</p>
<p>To define the term we will need that switches from positive to
negative, or 1 to -1, we can use the floor function. The floor function
rounds an input down to the nearest integer, for example <span
class="math inline">\(y=floor(x)\)</span>:</p>
<p><img src="../imgs/blog_1_desmos_8_3.png" title="Graph of y=floor(x)"
alt="img_graph" /><br />
</p>
<p>And <span class="math inline">\(y=floor(\frac{x}{\pi})\)</span>:</p>
<p><img src="../imgs/blog_1_desmos_9.png" title="Graph of y=floor(x/π)"
alt="img_graph" /><br />
</p>
<p>The floor function always rounds the input down to the nearest
integer, however notice we can transform the input and as a result round
the output down by different step lengths. Dividing x by <span
class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> results in x being rounded down every
<span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> instead of every 1.</p>
<p>We can alter this function in such a way that it will basically
return a 0 when the input is between 0 and <span
class="math inline">\(2\pi\)</span> and a 1 when the input is between
<span class="math inline">\(2\pi\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(4\pi\)</span>. Since the floor function can be
described as: <span class="math inline">\(y=floor(\frac{x}{n})\)</span>,
where n is the interval between each rounded output, the expression
<span class="math inline">\(y=floor(\frac{x}{2\pi})\)</span> will output
what we want: 0 from 0 to <span class="math inline">\(2\pi\)</span> and
then increase to 1 from <span class="math inline">\(2\pi\)</span> to
<span class="math inline">\(4\pi\)</span>. In our case, we don’t care
what the value of the function is outside of these intervals.</p>
<p>Now to define the term that will switch the sign of our <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{2\pi}{5}\)</span> term, from positive on the
interval 0 to <span class="math inline">\(2\pi\)</span> and negative on
the interval <span class="math inline">\(2\pi\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(4\pi\)</span>, we will raise -1 to the power of
the output of our floor function. So our new term will be defined as:
<span class="math inline">\(-1^{floor(\frac{\theta}{2\pi})}\)</span>.
Notice <span class="math inline">\({-1^{0}=1}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\({-1^{1}=-1}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now that we have a term that can switch signs, in other words switch
value from 1 to -1, we can implement it into our original polar star
expression, yielding a new expression defined as:</p>
<p><span
class="math display">\[r=\frac{1}{\cos\left(\operatorname{mod}\left(\theta-\frac{\pi}{10},\left(-1\right)^{\operatorname{floor}\left(\frac{\theta}{2\pi}\right)}\cdot\frac{2\pi}{5}\right)\right)}\]</span></p>

</p>
<p>Yay!! So that’s the expression I came up with in the end to draw a
five pointed star with a polar equation. I’m sure it’s not the only
polar equation that draws out a star like this, also functions like this
can always be slightly tweaked and modified to draw out a pretty much
endless amount of shapes and patterns (like in the above interactive
graph with the modulo operator for the diagonal line expression, there’s
a huge amount of things you can do with just one simple expression!) So
with this success, I’d now like to move on to graphing a five-pointed
star, but in the cartesian plane, that is with an expression in terms of
x and y.</p>
<p><img src="../imgs/star_2_2.png" alt="img_sep" /><br />
</p>
<p>My strategy for graphing a five-pointed star with x and y is to use a
parametric equation. Something like <span class="math inline">\(f(x(t),
y(t))\)</span> to describe a position over time. I could assign a point
to move according to this equation and trace out its path. Given the
correct equation, this would yeild a five-pointed star shape. To draw
out the star, the dot has to kind of go back and forth in both its x and
y axes. Considering this I defined functions for both x and y. They look
like this:</p>

title="Graph of the x and y components with respect to time of a parametric function that draws out a five-pointed star"
alt="img_graph" /><br />
</p>
<p>Both functions are basically zigzags going up and down at certain
intervals over time. Also there’s a section in the y function that is
flat, maybe you can guess why. Anyway to construct these two functions I
used peicewise functions of modulus expressions. The same used in the
previous polar expressions. I also multiplied x by the sign switching
term also in the previous polar expressions. This yeilds a function:</p>
<p><span
class="math display">\[y=\operatorname{mod}\left(x\cdot\left(-1\right)^{\operatorname{floor}\left(x\right)},1\right)\]</span></p>
<p><img src="../imgs/blog_1_desmos_11.png"
title="Graph of a zigzag line" alt="img_graph" /><br />
</p>
<p>The mod term is the same used in the previous polar expressions, used
to repeat a function over a specified interval. In this case I use it to
repeat x over the interval 1. In addition there’s yet another term used
in the previous polar expressions, <span
class="math inline">\((-1)^{floor(x)}\)</span>. This term switches from
1 to -1 to 1 and so on, on the interval of 1. This basically switches
the slope of the line every 1 giving it the zigzag-like appearance.</p>
<p>Using these functions, altering the amplitudes and frequencies, and
some trial and error I described the above peicewise functions of x and
y. A point can be assigned to move according to these functions, in
other words have its position determined by the x peicewise function and
y peicewise function with respect to time. The point’s position could be
expressed in the form: <span class="math inline">\(f(x(t),
y(t))\)</span>. So the movement of the point overtime would looke
like:</p>
<p><img src="../imgs/blog_1_desmos_15_5.gif" alt="img_graph" /><br />
</p>
<p>Adding a trail to show its path:</p>
<p><img src="../imgs/blog_1_desmos_16_31.gif" alt="img_graph" /><br />
</p>
<p>And you can probably see the reason why part of the y peicewise
function was flat, it’s because during that time, the dot is drawing the
side of the star that’s horizontal to the x axis, meaning the y value
doesn’t change. So that’s the method I used to graph a five-pointed star
with a parametric equation. Not really one single equation, instead I
peiced together multiple zigzag functions into expressions for both an x
position and y position with respect to time. Drawing out the path the
position moves on overtime, reveals the star. Next I’d like to describe
another method of drawing a five-pointed star, this more focused on
interior and exterior angles. This method involves creating a list of
points, then connecting them with line segments, forming a star.</p>
<p><img src="../imgs/star_2_2.png" alt="img_sep" /><br />
</p>
<p>Let’s describe the shape of a star in a different way than what we’ve
done up until now. Say instead of represtenting the star, or any shape,
with a function, we instead represent it with vectors. For each side of
a shape, there exists a vector pointing in that same direction. So a way
of describing a shape would be by a list of vectors. Each vector would
begin where the previous ends, and each would have a very specific
angle.</p>
<p>For example, a square could be represented by four vectors and each
vector’s angle would be <span
class="math inline">\(90\textdegree\)</span> greater than the previous.
Adding all the angles of the four vectors together that describe the
sides of the square yeilds <span
class="math inline">\(360\textdegree\)</span> (<span
class="math inline">\(4\times90\textdegree\)</span>.) or a full
rotation. This makes sense because the vectors should create a full
shape, in other words the sides of the shape start where they end,
making one full rotation. If the angles of the four vectors were smaller
or larger, they wouldn’t be able to connect to make a square. Another
example, the sides of an isosceles triangle. A vector’s angle in this
case would be <span class="math inline">\(120\textdegree\)</span>
greater than the previous vector. Again the angles of the three vectors
that make up the sides of the traingle sum to <span
class="math inline">\(360\textdegree\)</span>. We can alter the
difference in angles between the vectors, in other words the exterior
angles, to create a huge amount of different shapes.</p>

</iframe>
<p>Notice how any sided polygons can be made with the vectors if there
are enough. Also at a certain point (depending on the number of vectors)
the sides of the shape will rotated around a second time. This is what
creates the five sided star shape. Specifically when the exterior angles
are <span class="math inline">\(\frac{4\pi}{5}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\frac{6\pi}{5}\)</span> radians or <span
class="math inline">\(144\textdegree\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(216\textdegree\)</span>. Depending on the number
of vectors, or sides you have, any star or polygon can be made by
changing its exterior angles!</p>
<p>So those are just a few methods I’ve discovered that can be used to
construct a star mathematically. Some ways are speifically defined
composite functions and another slightly different way to describe
shapes and polygons with vectors and exterior angles. Anyway that’s a
quick summary of what I’ve learned, as always if you have questions or
